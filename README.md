# xorg-recipes #

This is a collection of recipes used to build the client-side X.Org libraries.

It was done to be able to fully build Qt5 on CentOS 5 (Qt5 needs xcb for OpenGL support) and shared
so other people can benefit from it. Specially there was some interest in adding those packages to
conda-forge. So when they settle on it, you are better of getting their packages/recipes.
